# Introduction

I have developed a simple e-commerce website using Django, which I would like to share on Git. This website is built with the aim of providing an easy-to-use platform for users to purchase items online.

# Getting started

To get started with the project, you will need to have Python and Django installed on your machine. Once you have these prerequisites installed, you can clone the repository and run the website on your local machine.

## To set up the database, you will need to run the following commands:

    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

Next, you can run the server by typing python manage.py runserver in the terminal. Once the server is running, you can navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your browser to view the website.

The website consists of several pages, including a homepage, a product listing page, a product detail page, a shopping cart page, and a checkout page. Users can browse through products, add items to their cart, and complete their purchase using the checkout page.

The website also includes an admin panel, which can be accessed at http://localhost:8000/admin. From here, administrators can add, update, and delete products and categories, view and manage orders, and perform other administrative tasks.

I hope you find this e-commerce website useful and easy to use. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me. Thank you for checking out my project!
